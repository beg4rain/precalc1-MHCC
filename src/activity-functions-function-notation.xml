    <title>Function Notation (Input, Output)</title>

    <introduction>
        <p>In this activity we develop an understanding of function notation by comparing statements we already understand in English to equivalent statements written in <q>math</q> language.   We interpret our statements about functions using graphs, tables and formulas.</p>

        <p>There are <m>34</m> questions in this activity.  All questions need to be answered correctly in order for the activity to be complete.  Each question is numbered and is written in bold.  A correct answer will show <q>correct</q> while an incorrect answer will show <q>Try again</q>.</p>

        <p>At the end of the activity you will see how many questions you answered correctly.</p>

        <p>After completing this lesson you will be able to:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>Interpret the meaning of function notation.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Use function notation to describe an event.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Evaluate a function.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <p>The prerequisites for this lesson are knowing how to read a graph or a table of values and how to use a formula to make a calculation.</p>

                </setup>
                <statement>
                    <p>Consider the graph below.</p>

                    <p>The dot on the graph represents the position of a train at a particular time. The blue crosshairs represent the time.</p>

                    <p>Adjust the time by sliding crosshairs left and right.  Notice that the train's distance, in miles, from downtown depends on the time, in hours, after 8 a.m.</p>

                    <p>Without knowing anything about function notation, you can still use a language you already know, English, to describe information about the train.</p>

                    <p>For instance:<ul>
                        <li>
                            <p>The train can only be in one place at any particular time.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>As time passes the train gets farther from downtown.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>The speed of the train changes during its trip.</p>
                        </li>
                    </ul></p>

                    <p>There are also some aspects of the graph itself that you can easily describe in English:<ul>
                        <li>
                            <p>The graph rises as we read it from left to right.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>Sometimes the graph is curved upwards.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>Sometimes the graph curves downwards.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>Some parts of the graph are steeper than others.</p>
                        </li>
                    </ul></p>

                    <p>In this lesson we learn to describe situations in math language using function notation.  Later the notation itself will allow us to use math in making calculations.</p>

                    <p>[@MODES(HTML=&gt;'&lt;iframe scrolling="no" src="https://www.geogebra.org/material/iframe/id/D4s2v4ft/width/450/height/459/border/888888/rc/false/ai/false/sdz/false/smb/false/stb/false/stbh/true/ld/false/sri/false/at/auto" width="450px" height="459px" style="border:0px;"&gt; &lt;/iframe&gt;', TeX =&gt;"A GeoGebra applet.");@]*</p>

                    <p>How far from downtown is the train <m><var name="$time" /></m> hours after 8 a.m.?</p>

                    <p><var name="$position" width="5" /> <var name="$units" form="popup" /></p>
                </statement>
            </webwork>
        </exercise>

        <p>In English you can communicate information about time and position in a simple sentence like</p>

        <blockquote>English:  <q>2 hours after 8 <init>a.m.</init> the train is 30 miles from downtown</q>.</blockquote>

        <p>Here is what that same sentence looks like in Spanish.</p>

        <blockquote>Spanish:  <q>2 horas despues de las 8 del la ma√±ana el tren esta 30 millas lejos del centro</q>.</blockquote>

        <p>Here is what that same sentence could look like in <q>math</q>.</p>

        <blockquote>Math:  <m>f(2) = 30</m></blockquote>

        <p>The math <q>sentence</q> above is actually an equation and it uses <term>function notation</term> to express the information about the train. Of course, the equation is meaningless unless the reader knows how the notation is defined.  If you know Spanish or <q>math</q> you can <em>interpret</em> the meaning of something you read in those languages into English.  There will be much interpretation in this class.</p>

        <p>In math we use variables and symbols to replace entire words or even entire sentences. For instance, instead of <q>Train's distance in miles from downtown</q> we can use the variable <m>D</m>. Instead of the <q>number of hours after 8 <init>a.m.</init></q>, we can use the variable <m>t</m>.</p>

        <p>We call the letters <m>D</m> and <m>t</m> variables because they represent values that can change.  Typically we use variables that have something to do with the context of the problem, but sometimes we generalize an expression or equation with <m>x</m>'s and <m>y</m>'s when we have nothing specific in mind.</p>

        <p>If the variables represent actual things or events we must define the varialbles to include the units we used to measure the event.</p>

        <blockquote>If <m>D</m> is distance you must define the units in which the distance is measured: miles, inches, centimeters, light years<ellipsis />what?</blockquote>

        <blockquote>If <m>t</m> is time, will it be measured with units of seconds, hours<ellipsis />years?</blockquote>

        <p>Since the position of the train depends on the amount of time that has passed, we say <q>the distance depends on time</q>.  In fact, the distance of the train from downtown is a <term>function of time</term>.</p>

        <p>Function notation allows us to communicate that distance is a function of time by simply writing <m>D = f(t)</m> [say, <q><m>D</m> equals <m>f</m> of <m>t</m></q>].  Don't confuse the notation with multiplication!  <m>f(t)</m> does <alert>not</alert> mean <m>f</m> times <m>t</m>.</p>

        <p>The format of function notation works on the basic principle of input and output.</p>

        <p>Choose some input, like a time, and the function gives an output like a distance.  The notation tells the reader what the input is by showing it in the parentheses.<me>f(\text{input}) = \mathit{output}</me> In the train problem, the function notation <m>f(0)</m> is telling us the input is <m>0</m>.  The value <m>0</m> in the parentheses means, <q>0 hours after 8 <init>a.m.</init></q>.  In other words it's 8 <init>a.m.</init></p>


        <p><m>f(0)</m> is an output.  It represents <q>the train's distance from downtown, <m>0</m> hours after 8 a.m.</q> Together, the input and output create an <term>ordered pair</term> <m>(0, f(0))</m>.  On a graph the ordered pair is a <term>point</term>.</p>

        <p>Its one thing to talk about, <q>The train's distance from downtown 2 hours after 8 a.m.</q> and a completely different thing to say what that distance actually is.</p>

        <p>In our train story <m>f(2)</m> represents the train's distance 2 hours after 8 a.m. To actually find the distance we must evaluate the funtion.</p>  

        <p><term>Evaluate</term> a function means to find the value of the output given an input value.  Therefore, evaluate <m>f(2)</m> in our example means <q>Find the train's distance from downtown 2 hours after 8 a.m.</q></p>

        <p>Typically we use graphs, tables or formulas to evaluate funtions.</p>

        <p>In general when the inputs and outputs are nothing in particular, we use <m>x</m> as input and <m>y</m> as output so that <m>y = f(x)</m>.  We use <q>x</q> as symbol to hold a spot for the actual input value while <m>y</m> is a spot holder for whatever the output value will be.  The <m>x</m> basically says, <q>When you get the input, put it here</q> in all the places where the <m>x</m> is.</p>

        <p>Consider this function <m>f(x) = 50x + 10</m>.  The function has no context (no story) so there are no units associated with either <m>x</m> or <m>y</m>.</p>

        <p>If <m>x = 1</m> then we can evaluate <m>f(1)</m>  by replacing the <q>x</q> in the formula with a 1.  Literally, <m>f(1)</m> means, <q>the formua with a 1 in it</q>.</p>

        <p>According to <url href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)">Wikipedia</url>, a function has the following definition:</p>
                
        <blockquote><q>In mathematics, a function is a relation between a set of inputs and a set of permissible outputs with the property that each input is related to exactly one output.</q></blockquote>

        <p>If you actually read the entire Wikipedia entry you will find the definition of a function can be quite lengthy in order to cover all the universe of mathematics.  In this activity we are going to keep the language simple, informal and we will use some analogies from our train story as examples.</p>
        
        <p>Remebmer this: One input, one output.</p>

        <p>A function is a rule that takes a piece of <q>usable</q> information that you pick and gives you some kind of result.  By <q>usable</q> we mean information that has meaning for the function.  In our train story the only usable information we can choose are times between <m>0</m> and <m>7</m> hours after 8 <abbr>a.m.</abbr> (inclusive).  We have no information about times less than <m>0</m> or greater than <m>7</m>.</p>

        <p>The most important part is that for each input the function gives you only one result, and each individual input always gives the same single result.</p>

        <p>For instance, for the train fuction <m>D = f(t)</m> at any given time like <m>t = 2</m> the train can only be in one place.  That's the only result.  It's not possible for the train to be in two or more places (results) at the same time.</p>
